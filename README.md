Here is a link to an article about API management: https://sdtimes.com/api/api-management-is-a-data-integration-problem/

I never considered the potential issues behind managing an API, such as data ownership and data profiling.
I also never realized how important APIs are in the context of the emergence of AI and machine learning.
The article introduces the concept of a "data mesh" to help with the problem of API management, which,
according to ThoughWorks, aims to challenge the norm of having data all in one place. Using a mesh-like
architecture, different data assets can be accessed and nintegrated within multiple different resources.
It's pretty similar to what APIs already do: the data mesh is supposed to provide an interface for
communication between the different resources.
